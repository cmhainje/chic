# chic

my personal matplotlib style library

## installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cmhainje/chic
```

## usage

currently includes all of [Paul Tol's colorschemes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/). on import, the default `prop_cycle` is set to use the `'tol_bright'` colorscheme, and all of Tol's sequential and diverging colorschemes are registered with matplotlib.
